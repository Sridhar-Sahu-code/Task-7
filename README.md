# 📊 Sales Data Analysis with SQLite, Pandas, and Matplotlib

This project demonstrates how to use **SQLite** as a lightweight database engine inside a **Jupyter Notebook**, and how to analyze and visualize the data using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

It’s a simple example that simulates product sales, aggregates quantities and revenues by product, and visualizes the revenue data in a bar chart.

- Use SQL to query aggregate data (`SUM`, `GROUP BY`)
- Load query results into a Pandas DataFrame
- Plot and save a revenue bar chart using Matplotlib
- Learn how to integrate SQL + Python + Plotting in a clean workflow
